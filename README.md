# Afterpay Select component

This is a custom React component to replace the default select HTML element.

## Custom component for displaying and selecting options.

This component is built using the Swiper.js library. It takes an array of values and displays them for the user in the form of a carousel slider. The component is mobile-ready, able to adapt to smaller screen sizes and its easily usable with either your finger, mouse or keyboard.
It has a number of built in customization options to allow it to blend in with your applications style.

- primaryColor (string) - Change the color of the default options and the subtitle text.
- secondaryColor (string) - Change the color of the arrows and the currently selected valu.
- backgroundColor (string) - As the name suggests you can change the color of the background, currently it's set to white (#fff) by default.
